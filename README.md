This project offers robotic technology for technical / scientific work in mobile robotics and swarm robots, using 3D printing tools, printed circuit board making, microcontroller programming, raspberry pi and the embedded implementation of ROS, you will be able to develop your own robotic agent and conduct your research in robotics on an experimental basis.

## Getting Started

To build this project, you must purchase the following bill of materials:

3 x Wheel Omni 1.5Pol

3 x Power Banck Pack for 2 Battery 18650

3 x Motor N20 6Vdc 90RPM and Encoder   

### Motor Speed Controller

The speed control of motors of a mobile robot is extremely important for the accomplishment of a good robotics project. This project involves the construction of a microcontrolled circuit for the speed control of each holonomic robot wheel, generating better performance of the position of the autonomous agent and the displacement controller.
